  <h2><span class = "terminale"> street-fighting-python:~$ </span>Comparison with the State of the Art</h2>
  <p> <span class = "terminale"> street-fighting-python:~$ </span> A lot of texts, articles, book and courses about python can be found on the Internet, so a question can rise spontaneously: "Why should we have to use yours guide, instead of another?". It's a good question, but we don't want to compare our guide to the ones in the State of the Art, because the method is completely different: we give you a goal and then we guide you through the way giving you the instruments to reach the goal. The other guides, instead, give you the instruments and then let you applicate them to what you want or you have to do. To make you free to choose what type of method is the right one for you, we have decided to give you also the list of the other guide available online.
